# Portfolio Mass Downloader

Does what it says on the tin. Will ask you to login to eMed with your credentials first, then downloads all your portfolio evidence to a folder called "downloaded" (yes, *all* of it).

Subdirectories are organised by evidence type, and then within that, the title of the evidence.

I've only tested it on my own computer with my own account so it might still be quite buggy. If you're having issues please raise them on the issues page or PM me on Facebook.
